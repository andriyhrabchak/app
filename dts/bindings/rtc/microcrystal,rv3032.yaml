      Automatic backup switchover function selection:
        - disabled: The switchover function is disabled - only one power supply available (VDD)
        - direct: Direct Switching Mode (DSM): PMU selects pin with the greater voltage (VDD or VBACKUP)
        - level: Level Switching Mode (LSM): when VDD < VTH:LSM (2.0 V) AND VBACKUP > VTH:LSM,
          switchover occurs from VDD to VBACKUP
